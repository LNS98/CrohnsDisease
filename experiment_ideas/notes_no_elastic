Previous experiments had outdated code (sadly due to accidental overwrite) - test data was also being augmented
Running again with slightly bigger resnet: [8, 16, 32, 16, 8]
Dropout used on final layer
Added translation into augmentation
Removed elastic (since really slow)

Augmentation: flip, rotation, translation, gaussian noise

If network overfits, it's because elastic has been removed. Also could be because anatomy outside colon included in volume (i.e. not yet cropped).

If network undefits, network is not big enough. In this case, try a bigger network first since augmentation is strong. Try bigger networks until hit sweetspot or it overfits.
